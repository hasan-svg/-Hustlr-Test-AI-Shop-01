Hey team.

This is an very simple app to show my knowledge on AI.
I'm expert in flask & yolo cv model creation.
I only worked on few project on NLP for my start-up. On that I had used huggingface model to eliminate the opeanai API cost by running on own server so, I made an simple feature for this test using huggingface.

Im not an expert in JS so i have used ChatGPT to help me on that part to be honest. I know how the code works in JS but i didn't code any like I did with python.

About the app:
- AI (NLP) Powerd search engine.
- Dynamic pricing based on rating.
- Recommendation based on category.

I have used chatGPT to generate me a dummy JSON of products.

How to use the AI Search:

Try this prompt: "i want a noise free headphones"
This brings the first product that the AI finds.

As there is a time limit to this project I cannot explain more. Hope we will sit and discuss about this if we work togeather.
